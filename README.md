## 📦 Overview

This project is part of a 4-week internship at *Saqaya, where the goal is to build a feature-rich e-commerce web application using **Vue 3* and *TypeScript*.

The app allows users to:

* Browse a list of products
* Navigate through a user-friendly interface

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* *Vue 3* (Options API → Composition API planned in week 4)
* *TypeScript*
* *Vite* (for fast development)
* *Vuex*
* *Pinia* (for state management, optional if used) (Future improvments)
* *Vercel* (for deployment)
* *CSS* (or any framework like Tailwind, if used)

## 🧠 Features

* *Dynamic Props*: Products passed using strongly-typed props.
* *Modal with Events*: Product details are shown in a modal triggered via props and closed using $emit.
* *Component-Based Design*: Clean and modular structure using reusable components.
* *Responsive Layout*: Works well on mobile and desktop.
* *Vite-Powered Dev Server*: Super fast development environment.

## Future improvements
* View detailed product information in a modal
* Add items to the cart
* Migrating to vue 3
