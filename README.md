## 📦 Overview

This project is part of a 4-week internship at _Saqaya, where the goal is to build a feature-rich e-commerce web application using \*\*Vue 3_ and _TypeScript_.

The app allows users to:

- Browse a list of products
- Navigate through a user-friendly interface

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- _Vue 3_ (Options API → Composition API planned in week 4)
- _TypeScript_
- _Vite_ (for fast development)
- _Vuex_
- _Pinia_ (for state management, optional if used) (Future improvments)
- _Vercel_ (for deployment)
- _CSS_ (or any framework like Tailwind, if used)

## 🧠 Features

- _Dynamic Props_: Products passed using strongly-typed props.
- _Modal with Events_: Product details are shown in a modal triggered via props and closed using $emit.
- _Component-Based Design_: Clean and modular structure using reusable components.
- _Responsive Layout_: Works well on mobile and desktop.
- _Vite-Powered Dev Server_: Super fast development environment.

## Future improvements

- View detailed product information in a modal
- Add items to the cart
- Migrating to vue 3
